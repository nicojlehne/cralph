# Cralph - Count | Rust | Alphabet

Cralph is a (very) crude rewriting of my other program Calph, which was written in C, in Rust.

Calph and Cralph both are supposed to accomplish the same job, counting characters in a user-supplied string, or, counting characters in a user-supplied file.

## Usage

To use cralph use:

```
cralph [options] [input] [optional: --log]
```

Available [options] are:

    --file : To open a file provided as filepath via [input].

    --text : To open text provided via [input].

    --log : To open a file provided as filepath after --log and write the programs output to it

    --help : To show this.

More functions to come.
